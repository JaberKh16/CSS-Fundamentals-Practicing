    :nth-of-type Pseudo Class Example
    =================================
    :nth-of-type Pseudo Class matches for the elements based on their position
    among the siblings of same type via specified argument. It takes a single 
    argument which represents the pattern while matching for the elements.
    This pseudo class starts its matching pattern from the starting/beginning index position.
    
    :nth-of-type Pseudo Class follows the following Syntax:
        Syntax: 
                    :nth-of-type(<nth>)
                where, <nth> is basically (An + B)/Odd-Value/Even-Value
    
    
    Note: There is no way to select the nth-of-class using this pseudo class selector. The
    selector looks at the type of only when creating the list of matches but can however apply 
    CSS to an element based on :nth-of-type location and a class.
