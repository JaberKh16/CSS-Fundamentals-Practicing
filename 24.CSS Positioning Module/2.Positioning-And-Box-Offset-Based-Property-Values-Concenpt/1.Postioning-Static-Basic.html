    CSS Positioning Property Concept
    ================================
    CSS Positioning Property- 'position' is used to position 
    element towards different direction in the web page. Positioning
    of element required Box Offset values(top, right, left, bottom) to 
    position the elements. Box Offset takes numeric units value to position
    the element. Box Offset values can take either positive(+) or negative(-)
    values of numeric units while positioning the elements.

    'position' property have some following values:
    1) static   ; denotes static position, which is by default
    2) relative ; denotes relative position, relative position for any element is
                defined by their parent element(means any child element relative 
                to its parent element).If parent element doesn't define its property
                'position' then child element will relative to the viewport.
    
    3) absolute ; denotes absolute position, when position is absolute then it will collapsing
                between the neighbors elements, so always use parent element position to 'relative'.
                By default 'absolute' is also relative to HTML Element. If parent element position
                is not defined then position towards HTML element and if parent element position is
                specified then postion towards the parent element postion value.
    4) fixed    ; denotes fixed position, while position is fixed then the element will be fixed
                towards that specific box offset position, even the scrolling happens that fixed 
                element will be fixed at that position though relative to its document flow means viewport.
                So, position value 'fixed' is always position towards viewport.
    5) sticky   ; denotes sticky position, when position is sticky that specific element will be act like
                fixed at that specific position specified by Box Offset as condition uptil that point 'sticky' 
                will be fixed even if the scroll occurs and when element is reach
                its specified viewport then sticky element will move with its parent element.
