    CSS Clear Property Concept
    ==========================
    CSS Clear Property- 'clear' is used to clear any floating 
    element. To clear any floating element the 'clear' must target
    the actual property indicating by the 'float' property setted value,
    otherwise clear won't work.
    
    When we use the float property and we basically want the next element to be setted on 
    below (not on the right or left), we will have to use the clear property.



    The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.

    'clear' property have some following values:
    1) none     ; denotes no clearing of element which is by default. 
    2) left     ; denotes clearing towards left direction means below left floated elements
    3) right    ; denotes clearing towards right direction means below right floate elements
    4) both     ; denotes clearing towards left and right direction, mostly used 
                if unsure about the direction from what floating element to be clear.
                
    When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, 
    then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the 
    cleared element will appear below it on the web page.
