    Text Emphasis Property Example
    ==============================
    The text-emphasis-position CSS property describes where emphasis marks are drawn at. 
    The effect of emphasis marks on the line height is the same as for ruby text: if 
    there isn't enough place, the line height is increased. So, Text Emphasis Property 
    does what is basically its put some symbols or characters with the text content. 
    Remember one thing, only one emphasis will be included with each letter in the text 
    even if you provide multple characters while setting the 'text-emphasis' 
    property value as character format. 
    
    Note: Chrome 25.x previous version dont support 'text-emphais' property till now
    so open thish .html file with Mozilla Firefox Web Browser to see the effect.
