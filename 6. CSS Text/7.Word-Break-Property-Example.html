    Word Break Property Example
    ===========================
    'word-break' property supports breaking of completes words whenever line break happens(means whenever text content goes in new line complete words break can happen). Browser by default holds 'normal' value as 'word-break' property mean browser dont support complete word breaking. Let's talk about the 'word-break' property values which does what:
        1) normal       ; dont allow any breaking between complete words.
        2) break-all    ; allow breaking of completes words whenever reach to text content  
                        reach to new line.
        3) keep-all     ; generally works like 'normal' values but can also support break  
                        of words.

    <h2>Uranus Planet Information</h2>
    <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.

        It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the scientific community accepted Bode's suggestion to name it Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Bode.â€‹
