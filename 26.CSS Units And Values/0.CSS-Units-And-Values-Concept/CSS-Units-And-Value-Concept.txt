CSS Units And Values Concept
============================
CSS Units And Values have some properties which can be divided into 2 categories generally which 
are the following:
    1) Distance Units
	2) Quantities Units
	3) Functional Notation

1)Distance Units
================
Distance Units further can be divided into two categories which are the following:
	1) Absolute Units ==> pc(picas), pt(point), Q(Quater Milimeter), px(Pixel), mm(Milimeter), cm(Centimeter),inch(Inces)
	2) Relative Units ==> divided into two categories -- a) Font Relative Units b) View Port Relative Units

Absolute Units
--------------
Absolute Units Actual Values Can be follows:
a) 1pc = 16px
b) 1Q  = 1px
c) 1px = 1px
d) 1pt = 1.32812px
e) 1in = 96px
f) 1mm = 3.76562px
g) 1cm = 37.7812px

Relative Units
--------------
a) Font Relative Units
  --------------------
  1) em(emphasize)
  2) rem(relative emphasize)
  3) ch(character length size) - 1ch = 8px, varies length with no. of characters
  4) ex(x-height) - denotes x-height of the current font or half of 1em changes as the font-family changes.

b) ViewPort Relative Units
  ------------------------
  ViewPort is nothing but the visible area of any devices. It has some following values which are:

  	1) vw(viewport width)  - denotes 100% of the screen width size
  	2) vh(viewport height) - denotes 100% of the screen height size
	3) vmin(viewportmin)   - denotes the viewport minimum width or height with the resizing of devices screen size, where width and height
				  any one of them can be setted and it will be calculated minimum of the viewport as screen resizes or changes.
	4) vmax(viewportmax)   - denotes the viewport maximum width or height with the resizing of devices screen size, where width and height
				  any one of them can be setted and it will be calculated maximum of the viewport as screen resize or changes.


2) Quantities Units
===================
Quantities Units has 3 categories which are the following:
   1) Angle Units
   2) Duration Units
   3) Frequencies Units

Angle Units
-----------
Angle Units has some following values:
		
	a) deg  - denotes degree value 
	b) rad  - denotes radian value
	c) grad - denotes gradian value
	d) turn - denotes turn value 
   
Values can be interpreted as follows mathematically,
   		
	360 deg = 400 grad
	360 deg = 6.28 rad
	360 deg = 1 turn

Duration Units
--------------
Duration Units has some following values:
  	a) s  - denotes seconds duration
	b) ms - denotes miliseconds duration

Frequencies Units
-----------------
Though most browser didn't support it properly so we are not gonna discuss about it.


3) Functional Notation
======================
1) calc(mathmatical-expression)  - to calculate the length any mathematical expression passed as CSS Length property values.It allows 
                                   mathematical expression to be used as component values. Provides ability to use mix units. Calculation
				    of mathematical expression is conducted from left to right.
				    
				    Note: Prefix such as -moz, -webkit is needed to cover earlier firefoz and Chrome versions.
