    CSS ViewPort Relative Unit Values
    =================================
    ViewPort is nothing but the visible area of any devices. 
    It has some following values which are:

    1) vw(viewport width)  - denotes 100% of the screen width size
    2) vh(viewport height) - denotes 100% of the screen height size
	3) vmin(viewportmin)   - denotes the viewport minimum width or height 
                            with the resizing of devices screen size, where width and height
							any one of them can be setted and it will be calculated 
                            minimum of the viewport as screen resizes or changes.
	4) vmax(viewportmax)   - denotes the viewport maximum width or height with the resizing 
                            of devices screen size, where width and height any one of them 
                            can be setted and it will be calculated maximum of the 
                            viewport as screen resize or changes.
