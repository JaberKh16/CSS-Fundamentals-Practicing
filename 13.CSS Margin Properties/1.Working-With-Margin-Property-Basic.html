    Working With CSS Margin Property
    ================================    
    CSS Margin Property denotes the spaces between the elements. CSS Margin property
    has different types of individual properties while working on setting the 
    margin property which are the following:
        1) margin-top       ; to set the top margin
        2) margin-bottom    ; to set the bottom margin
        3) margin-left      ; to set the left margin
        4) margin-right     ; to set the right margin
    
    Also, Shorthand Properties can be passed while setting the Margin Property as well.
    While working with the shorthand margin property 4 ways following ways it can be done:
        
        1) if single value passed as margin then that single value is setting for (top,left,bottom,right).
        2) if two values passed as margin then 1st value will set the (top, bottom) and 2nd will set the (left, right).
        3) if three values passed as margin then 1st value will set for the top, 2nd value for the (left, right)
            and 3rd value will be set for the bottom.
        4) if four values passed as margin then invidual sides/direction can be setted with individual values.
            where the order/sequence will be like - (top, right, bottom, left).
