    CSS Element Height and Width Property
    =====================================
    CSS Height and Width property generally works based on the type of the elements itself.
    CSS normally have two types of elements- 
        1) Block Level Element 
        2) Inline Element
    
    where Block Level Element Height is basically the Margin of that Block Level Element 
    which is 100% refers to the available height given by its parent container means any kind
    of Block Level Element is getting its height relative to its parent container height, same as 
    for the width property. So if wanted to change the height of any block level element change the
    height of its parent container to make an effect of height changes on that element. 
    
    Note: Parent Height is dynamically holds as its contents required it to be means that Parent
    container height is nothing but the reflection of no. of elements it holds inside it.
