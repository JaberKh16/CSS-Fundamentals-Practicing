            <p>The band released their first album Once Only Imagined on August 14, 2007. Originally intended as a demo, the release prompted the Agonist to add metal drummer Simon McKay to the band. Released August 28, 2007, the video for "Business Suits and Combat Boots" was filmed by acclaimed director David Brodsky[2] (Strapping Young Lad, Gwar, God Forbid).[3] The video was voted the number 6 video of the year 2007 on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball.[4]</p>
            <h3>2.Lullabies for the Dormant Mind (2008−2010)</h3>
            <p>The band released their second album, called Lullabies for the Dormant Mind, in March 2009.[8] The mini-video for "...And Their Eulogies Sang Me To Sleep" off the album Lullabies for the Dormant Mind, also filmed by director David Brodsky,[2] was released April 18, 2009. </p>
            <h3>3.Prisoners (2011–2013)</h3>
            <p>In late 2011, the Agonist took part in the "Pandemonium over North America" tour with Kamelot, Alestorm and Blackguard (except Guitarist Danny Marino, who was unable to tour with the band and was replaced by ex-Catalyst guitarist Justin Deguire). While on tour, the band sold an EP entitled The Escape which showcased two tracks scheduled to appear on the band's third full-length album.[13] It was mixed by Tue Madsen who is known for his work with the Haunted, Dark Tranquillity and Suicide Silence.

            <h3>4.White-Gluz's departure, Eye of Providence and Five (2014–2019)</h3>
            <p>In March 2014, White-Gluz announced that she had been chosen as the replacement for Angela Gossow as frontwoman of the Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy. She also revealed that the group as fans knew it was "over" and that she and they had parted ways. Vicky Psarakis was then revealed as the new lead singer of the group. In April 2017, White-Gluz revealed detailed the circumstances of her departure and how she considered it the "biggest betrayal" she'd ever felt in her life.[17] The Agonist later released their own public statement disputing her account, citing unprofessional behavior and a lack of respect for fans and band mates - among other things - as the reason for her departure, and that the band is "breathing a lot easier" in her absence.[18] On July 9, 2014, the band had officially announced via Facebook that their fourth album, Eye of Providence, was released on February 23. Five followed on September 30, 2016.</p>
