    CSS Keyframes Basic Concept
    ===========================
    CSS Keyframes are the frames which can be used to define the frames while
    working with the animation based work.
    To create a frame the keywork,   '@keyframes' is used.
    Syntax:
        @keyframes keyframe-name{
            from{}
            to{}
        }
        @keyframes keyframe-name{
            0%{}
            100%{}
        }

    In above two ways keyframes can be created, though there has some condition which denotes\
    what will be suitable in what situation.
    
    1) If animation has 2 states only then used the following:
        @keyframes keyframe-name{
            from{}
            to{}
        }
    
    2) If animation need more than 2 states then used the following:
        #keyframes keyframe-name{
            0%{}
            10%{}
            25%{}
            50%{}
            75%{}
            100%{}
        }
    
    Keyframes name is case-sensitive means having spelling mistake while including the 
    keyframes in the animation-name based property will not infer anything.

    Defining multiple keyframes can be supported where indiviudal keyframes will be include
    with the 'animation-name' property with comma separeted ways.
