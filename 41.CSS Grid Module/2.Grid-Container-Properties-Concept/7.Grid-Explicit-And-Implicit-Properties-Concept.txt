Concept About Explicit And Emplicit Tracks
==========================================
Tracks are the gaps between the rows and columns individual items.

Implicit Tracks
----------------
Notice when only the 'grid-template-columns' without defining rows has been defined in
the stylesheet then there are rows can be seen also though those are not defined, how 
is possible even- well browser automatically define those rows. This way of automatically
creation of rows is called the Implicit Tracks.


Explicit Tracks
---------------
Explicit Tracks are defined only the users, it is consisting of columns and
rows defined with the properties of 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns'.
