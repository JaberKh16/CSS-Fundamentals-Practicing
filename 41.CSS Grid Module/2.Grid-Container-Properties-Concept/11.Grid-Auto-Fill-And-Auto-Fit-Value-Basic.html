    Grid Module Container Property Value- 'auto-fit' and 'auto-fill'
    ================================================================
    'auto-fit' value is trying to fit as many items possible to the grid container where
    in the container every individual items will take similar kind of height and width
    to the grow or shrink to fit the whole container.

    'auto-fill' value is also trying to fill as many items as possible to the grid container
    where in the container every individual items will take their specified width and height
    only.

    For example- 
        
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr))
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr))
    
    In above, every 100px threshold of spaces will add a new column to the grid container
    as the size of the grid grows, which is also same for the 'auto-fill' value also at certain
    point. 'auto-fit' will include those columns of same size are being specified to fit the grid
    whereas 'auto-fill' will include those many columns as grows it will keep including another
    columns even if there has no column to add.

    Now, under the hood, both 'auto-fit' and 'auto-fill' added new column tracks as the grid grows
    but 'auto-fit' added the new column track having 0px in width whereas 'auto-fill' keep adding new 
    column tracks which are basically empty.
