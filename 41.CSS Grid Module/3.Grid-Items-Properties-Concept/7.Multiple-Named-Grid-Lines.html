    Grid Module Property- Naming Grid Lines 
    =======================================
    Grid Module Item Property- Named Grid Lines Property is used to determine  
    the grid lines name and then to work with those grids lines use those
    names to target those grids. Named Grid Lines are essentially provided 
    extra context of how the grid is structured.

    Grid Lines are basically the virtual lines which exists each side of the Grid Tracks.
    Grid Lines counting generally, start from 1 to n (if left to right default one), 
    opposite wise n to 1(if right to left) for the columns as well as for the rows.

    Syntax:
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 200px [grid-line-name1] 1fr [grid-line-name2] 200px;
        grid-template-rows: 1fr 200px [grid-line-name1] 1fr [grid-line-name2];
        grid-column-start: grid-line-name1;
        grid-row-name: grid-line-name2;
    
    In the above, naming grid lines are defined through the [] with a name for the 
    specified grid lines.

    Named Grid Lines also have some predefined values for denoting the 'start' and 'end' of
    the grid lines like the following:
        
        grid-template-columns: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line-name1] 1fr 200px [end];
        grid-template-rows: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line-name1] 1fr [end];

    
    To work with the Spanning with Name Grid Lines, need to specify both starting and ending
    value, otherwise spanning won't work. Now see the following:
        
        grid-template-columns: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line1] 1fr 200px [end];
        grid-template-rows: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line1] 1fr [end];
        grid-column-start: span grid-line1;
        grid-column-end: span end;

    Providing a multiple naming for the single grid line is also possible and to provide
    a multiple can be done through a space between two names which can be like the following:
        
        grid-template-columns: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line1 grid-line2] 1fr 200px [end];
        grid-template-rows: [start] 1fr 200px [grid-line1 grid-line2] 1fr [end];
