    CSS Grid Layout Basic Concept
    =============================
    CSS Grid Layout is a layout model that has powerful abilities to 
    control the sizing of boxes and their content. It is two dimensional
    layout which generally indicates rows and columns in particular.
    
    Grid Terminology
    ----------------
    Grid Layout propose some terminology to understand its theoretical 
    perspective to know about its layout contains which are the following:
    
    a) Grid Container   - denotes the wrapper of the Grid Cells.
    b) Grid Cells       - denotes the cells inside the Grid Container.
    c) Grid Lines       - denotes the virtual lines which exists on each side of Grid Tracks 
                        that basically either on vertical side or horizontal side to divide 
                        grid and separate the columns and rows. Grid Line counting start from 
                        1 to n (if left to right default one), opposite wise n to 1(if right to left)
                        for the columns as well as for the rows.
    d) Grid Track       - denotes the either the Grid Row Height or Grid Column Width, now to specify that 
                            1) if its in horizontal position - Grid Row
                            2) if its in vertical position   - Grid Column
    e) Grid Area        - denotes a rectangular area space which can be normally consisting of
                        either 2 by 2 items, 3 by 4 items etc which can applicable to become 
                        a rectangular based shape.
    f) Grid Gap/Gutter  - denotes the spaces between the rows or columns(basically grid track).
                        although can't possible to configure individual gap size between 
                        two grid tracks.
    g) Grid Item        - denotes the child element in a grid which can be fit inside a cell.

    

    Grid Container Display Property
    -------------------------------
    Grid Supports two kinds of values to form a grid based layout which can be
    set by the property 'display' where 'display' property supports two types of 
    values for the grid layout which are the following:
        
        a) display: grid            ; sets the items in rows fashion which by default take the viewport
                                    width means whole width of page.
        b) display: grid-inline     ; will shrink the items sizes based on the content size, unless the grid
                                    container being set the specific size.

    Advantage Of Grid Layout
    ------------------------
    1) Flexiblity while changing the layouts or adjusting the content which wasn't fix by Flexbox
    2) less markup need to design layouts, reduces nesting of HTML
    3) Focusses on positioning child elements into a specific position inside of a single parent element. 
    4) works with responsive web design.
    4) supported by most of the browsers
    5) higly customizable, rows and columns can be of different sizes.
    4) skips the use of frameworks like - Bootstrap
