    Working With CSS Padding Shorthand Property
    ===========================================
    CSS Shorthand Property on Padding follows the following order sequences:
        padding: top, left, bottom, right;
    
    Although, Shorthand Properties can be passed while setting the Padding Property as well.
    While working with the shorthand padding property 4 ways following ways it can be done:
        
        1) if single value passed as padding then that single value is setting for (top,left,bottom,right).
        2) if two values passed as padding then 1st value will set the (top, bottom) and 2nd will set the (left, right).
		3) if three values passed as padding then 1st value will be top, 2nd will be left and right, 3rd will be bottom. 
        4) if four values passed as padding then invidual sides/direction can be setted with individual values.
            where the order/sequence will be like - (top, right, bottom, left).
